-Or by dropping directly the product to the page (drop down=

Products are displayed in a table, 3 attributes are displayed.
-you can remove the product with a button.
-if the quantity is 0, the description could show “Out of order”
-you have a search bar to find product by name.

Pop-up:
-after clicking the “Add product” button or dropping a picture, a pop-up appears to provide information on the uploaded product:
-name, quantity, price and colour. These have the following default values:
o Name: “Product 123111” where 111 is a sequence

The button “Save” is used to save the product to the DB, and the button “Cancel” to disregard the product upload.
